## 🛠️ System Architecture  
1. **Models**:  
   - **RCNN** for violence and fire detection.  
   - **Faster RCNN** for weapon detection.  

2. **Deployment**:  
   - Three models deployed separately on different systems (e.g., laptops or AWS EC2 instances).  
   - Each model processes video feeds from network cameras.  

3. **Communication**:  
   - Detected events are communicated to a central mobile application using APIs.
